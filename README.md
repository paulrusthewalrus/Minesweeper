# Minesweeper (Project Status: Completed)
Using the Tkinter Python library, I recreated Minesweeper for Python 3.6 onwards (tested). One useful feature of this program is that the dimensions of the GUI are relative to the number of mines you play with, hence, games will always feel as balanced as the last.

## Dependancies
- Tkinter

## Visuals
### Selecting the number of mines

### Gameplay pictures
